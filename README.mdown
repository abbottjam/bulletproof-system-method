# Bulletproof 'system' method

An alternative 'system' method for Ruby, that raises programmer-friendly exceptions
when execution results in an error.

By default, the Ruby 'system' method will return (on Mac OS X):

```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
system('ls')
```
=> true, exit code: 0

```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
system('ls |Â grep')
```
=> false, exit code: 2

```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
system('foo')
```
=> nil, exit code: 127

In UNIX, when commands are executed at the shell, the above exit codes mean:

- 0:   Success on executing a command
- 2:   Inappropriate use of a recognized command
- 127: Command not found

Clicking this number[^fn-sample_footnote] will lead you to a footnote.

However because true, false, and nil are return values of Ruby methods, they are
the ones returned from executing shell scripts from Ruby and propagated to caller
methods. This causes problems, in particular when Ruby silently swallows a non-existing
command by returning nil (a non-error return value).

The Ruby exception hierarchy has exceptions that much better map to the UNIX
error codes - hence this workoaround / wrapper function.
