# Bulletproof 'system' method

An alternative 'system' method for Ruby, that raises programmer-friendly exceptions
when execution results in an error.

By default, the Ruby 'system' method will return (on Mac OS X):

```ruby
system('ls')        => true #exit code: 0
system('ls |Â grep') => false #exit code: 2
system('foo')       => nil #exit code: 127
```

In UNIX, when commands are executed at the shell, the above exit codes mean:

- 0:   Success on executing a command
- 2:   Inappropriate use of a recognized command
- 127: Command not found

More [on exit codes here][1].

However because true, false, and nil are return values of Ruby methods, they are
the ones returned from executing shell scripts from Ruby and propagated to caller
methods. This causes problems, in particular when Ruby silently swallows a non-existing
command by returning nil (a non-error return value):

- [Null References the Billion Dollar Mistake][2]
- [If You Gaze Into Nil, Nil Gazes Also Into You][3]

The [Ruby exception hierarchy][4] has exceptions that much better map to the UNIX error codes -
hence this workaround / wrapper function.
